                    Create your delicious homemade pizza with the following steps:<br>
                    1. Start by preparing your pizza dough. You can either make it from scratch or buy pre-made dough from the store.<br>
                    2. Roll out the dough into your desired pizza shape and thickness.<br>
                    3. Spread a layer of your favorite pizza sauce over the dough.<br>
                    4. Add your favorite toppings such as cheese, pepperoni, veggies, and more.<br>
                    5. Bake in a preheated oven according to the dough instructions or until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted.<br>
                    6. Remove from the oven, let it cool for a few minutes, and then slice and enjoy your homemade pizza!
